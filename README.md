# Contact_Network
The contact network will give an idea about the contacts taking place in a public transport.
We have considered a train route from Kharagpur to Howrah ( WB, India ), wherein we have got the list of passengers boarding and de-boarding at each station from the train simulation model and then developed a contact network consisting of the details of two persons with whom the contacts are taking place. In the entire train, i code traced around 8 lakh contacts, which will be helping us in tracing the spread of infection
